This Fake News Detection project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to classify news articles as real or fake. It leverages a Kaggle dataset and applies text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and Logistic Regression for binary classification.

ðŸ§  Model Details

Model Used: Logistic Regression

Features: TF-IDF vectors (top 5000 features)

Preprocessing: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, stemming

Evaluation: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report

Prediction: Includes a custom function to classify new input text

ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Replace Logistic Regression with models like Random Forest, SVM, or BERT

Use lemmatization and n-gram features

Implement deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU)

Create a web app using Flask or Streamlit

Add real-time detection via social media API integration

This project is a simple and effective baseline for fake news classification and can be extended for more advanced applications.
